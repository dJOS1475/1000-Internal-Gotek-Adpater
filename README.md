Tandy 1000 Internal Gotek Adpater

This Tandy 1000 Internal Gotek Adapter allows you to use Gotek Virtual Floppy Drives with Tandy 1000's that send power over the Floppy cable.

Tandy 1000's that have power supplied via the Floppy Cable include the SL/2, TX, TL, TL/2, TL/3.

I made these because many folks wanted to use Gotek Virtual Floppy Drives with their Tandy's but due to the non-standard power-over-cable-design were unable to.

I highly recommend using the free FlashFloppy Firmware on Gotek Drives as the stock FW is quite poor. On my TL/2, I found that the FlashFloppy FF.CFG file needs the "pin34" option set to "chg" to enable Disk Change detection.
